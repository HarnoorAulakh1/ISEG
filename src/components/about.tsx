          Founded in 1965 at Kolkata, the Indian Society of Engineering Geology
          has just completed forty seven years of its existence. It was
          inaugurated by Dr. K.L.Rao, the then Union Minister of Irrigation and
          Power on 15 October 1965 at Kolkata. Under the able guidance of Dr.
          D.N.Wadia, the Founder President of the Society and the doyen of
          Indian Geology, the Society commenced its journey with the aim to
          promote the study of Engineering Geology and allied sciences.

          In fact, the Society, over the years, has effectively served as a
          formidable bridge between the geologists and engineers; has provided a
          vibrant platform for discussing and debating a host of geotechnical
          problems and state-of-the-art technologies; and projected the Nation's
          achievements in the field of Geotechniques before the world.
        </p>

          The Engineering and Geoscientific community from across the nation,
          representing almost all the leading organisations engaged in civil
          development projects, constitutes the membership base of the Society.
          In its forty one years of dedicated service to the nation, the Society
          has brought out its annual Journal of Engineering Geology,
          incorporating a host of scientific papers on various themes and has
          also published some prestigious volumes like the “Indian Monuments
          Through the Ages” and “Geotechnical Features of Major Dams in India”.
          The Society launched its bi-annual newsletter – the ISEG News – in
          March 2004, hailed as another milestone in the Society’s illustrious
          journey. Keeping pace with the trends of the times, the Society has
          launched this Website on 22 December 2006.

        <p className="text-center">
          From time to time, the Society has been providing fora for technical
          deliberations on relevant topics and has organised a number of
          Symposia/ Seminars/ Workshops, e.g. at Dehradun (1981, 2002), Shillong
          (1985), Lucknow (1988, 1996, 1998, 2004), Kolkata (1990), Vadodara
          (1991), Bhopal (1999), etc. The Society also earned the rare
          distinction by hosting the four-yearly prestigious International
          Congress of the International Association of Engineering Geology
          (presently International Association for Engineering Geology and the
          Environment) at New Delhi in 1982, that was attended by large number
          of delegates from across the world.
