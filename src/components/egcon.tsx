            On its Diamond Jubilee anniversary, Indian Society of Engineering
            Geology (ISEG), the Indian National Group of International
            Association for Engineering Geology and the Environment (IAEG),
            announces EGCON 2025 - International Conference on Engineering
            Geology and Geohazards at New Delhi on 01-03 December 2025.
            Organised in collaboration with the IAEG and Geological Survey of
            India (GSI), the conference provides a vibrant platform for
            exchanging state-of-the-art development in the fields of engineering
            geology, geotechnical engineering, and geohazards. We, the Executive
            Council of the ISEG and Team EGCON 2025 take pride in inviting you
            to join us at the celebrations and to the conference. We assure you
            of an unforgettable experience at EGCON 2025 and of a unique
            opportunity of interaction with committed experts from industry and
            academia from across the globe. The international guests are invited
            to explore a developed and Viksit new India and experience its
            traditional and warm hospitality.

            It was at the XXII IGC (International Geological Congress) at New
            Delhi in December 1964 that the engineering geological fraternity
            attending the IGC gave due credence to the global surge in
            engineering geological activities and initiated the proposal of a
            Commission or an International Organisation in Engineering Geology.
            A group of “Eight” with Mr A. Shadmon of Israel as the main
            initiator, and leading Indian engineering geologists like Shri M.S.
            Balasundaram and V.S. Krishnaswamy of the GSI onboard, took the
            initiative that in due course led to the creation of the
            International Association for Engineering Geology. Affiliated to the
            International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and associated
            with the Federation of International Geo-engineering Societies
            (FedIGS), the IAEG is a renowned international organization. The
            IAEG unites the national engineering geological organisations and
            keeps serving the global society with iconic features like the
            Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment, four-yearly
            International Congresses, frequent Regional Engineering Geological
            Conferences, etc The ISEG was inaugurated on 15 October 1965 in the
            premises of the GSI at the erstwhile Calcutta by an eminent engineer
            and the then Union Minister for Irrigation and Power Dr KL Rao.
            Following the mandate contained in the Articles and Bylaws of the
            Society, the torch bearers donned the mantle of the serious
            crusaders and proactively engaged themselves in the dissemination of
            geoscientific information through publications and deliberations at
            various events. The ISEG carries on its rich heritage and keeps
            serving as a formidable bridge between geologists and engineers;
            provides vibrant platform for discussions and debate on a host of
            geotechnical problems and state-of-the-art technologies; and
            projects the nation's achievements in the field of geotechniques and
            allied expertise. The ISEG takes pride in having hosted IAEG
            sponsored events, viz. the prestigious 4th International Congress of
            IAEG at New Delhi in 1982; 8th Asian Regional Conference of IAEG at
            Bangalore in 2011; and Golden Jubilee International Conference EGNM
            at New Delhi in the year 2015. The proposed EGCON 2025 is a
            testimony to the ISEG's efforts in keep bringing the international
            engineering geological fraternity together for vibrant deliberations
            on the development in the industry and academia.
